==========

a html5 canvas full of a bunch of squares that you can color.
and just when you thought the fun was all over, you can add
a snazzy caption at the bottom.

to-do:
======

- parse caption into multiple lines when reaching a certain length
- export/share button
- get the fill tool to work the way normal fill tools work
