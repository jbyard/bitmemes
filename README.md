==========

a html5 canvas full of a bunch of squares that you can color.
and just when you thought the fun was all over, you can add
a snazzy caption at the bottom.

there are two "tools" for drawing: a single square painter and 
a mis-behaving fill tool.  The fill tool colors all the squares
on the sheet that are the same color as the square the user clicks
on.  It's a little sloppy, it only fills up to the click location.

the 8 bit / 16 bit doesn't really work yet

the "make Json" link writes the current sheet to the browser window
as a JSON object.  I've been cutting and pasting that into a new .js 
file as a crude save/load routine.  yup.
